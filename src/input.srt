<i>aAll singing:in
Boob world, boob world.</i>

4
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,267
<i>It's a world for you,
but it's actually two.</i>

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,100
<i>Boob World!</i>

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,600
<i>I gotta say, Morty, it's weird
that you wanted me to come,</i>

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,504
<i>but I'm actually
exstyched about it --</i>

8
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:28,703
<i>that's excited, stoked,
and psyched.</i>

9
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,174
<i>I didn't want you to come.
Talk to Rick.</i>

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,030
<i>Truth is, Summer, Boob World's
been at the center</i>

11
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,366
<i>of a few protests every day
for 30 years,</i>

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,600
<i>so they've recently rebranded as
a boob empowerment experience,</i>

13
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:39,274
<i>and if we bring a female,
we get in for free.</i>

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,700
<i>So, I'm, like, what, a Coke can
you're taking to Six Flags?</i>

15
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,434
<i>No, 'cause once you
get into Six Flags,</i>

16
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:44,927
<i>you can throw
your Coke can away.</i>

17
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:46,266
<i>No fucking way.</i>

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,800
<i>It can't be.</i>

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
Oh, look at that.</i>

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,670
<i>-What is it?
-It's a GoTron ferret.</i>

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,600
<i>It's not a GoTron ferret,
Morty.</i>

22
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:58,534
<i>It's the blue
GoTron ferret.</i>

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
<i>Boob World is canceled.
No, Rick, no.</i>

24
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:03,733
<i>You promised.
You always do this.</i>

25
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,397
<i>Tell you what, Morty,
I'll let you choose.</i>

26
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,603
<i>Do you really think
Boob World -</i>

27
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,104
<i>Yes.
Let me finish.</i>

28
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,273
<i>Is more important --
Yes.</i>

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Let me finish!
Than have all five</i>

30
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:13,334
<i>of the only five GoTron ferrets
in the universe?</i>

31
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,197
<i>Are you finished?
Yes. So, let's go.</i>

32
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,103
<i>Summer, help me hook the winch
up to the ferret.</i>

33
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:18,333
<i>Sure.
What the hell?!</i>

34
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:19,667
<i>You said you were
letting me choose.</i>

35
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
<i>Yeah, whether to break
my fucking heart.</i>

36
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,334
<i>You chose badly.</i>

37
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:24,867
<i>Morty:
That's how it all began.</i>

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,870
<i>To my sister,
it was just another game.</i>

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,530
<i>But what she
didn't know --</i>

40
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,097
<i>Summer: That was the moment
everything changed.</i>

41
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,633
<i>Morty:
Wait. What?</i>

42
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,827
<i>I had gotten my first taste of
respect and my first voiceover.</i>

43
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:35,497
<i>I can hear you.
Can you hear me?</i>

44
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:37,773
<i>And I knew then and there
I wanted more of both.</i>

45
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,970
<i>Hello?</i>

46
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:12,766
<i>Beth, Jerry,
do something fun with us.</i>

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,800
<i>A giant monster is attacking
in the Nibblenug system.</i>

48
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,204
<i>Your suits
are in the bathroom.</i>

49
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,433
<i>Mine smells skeletony.</i>

50
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:18,767
<i>I have a chiropractor
appointment.</i>

51
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,030
<i>What are you
involving us in?</i>

52
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,866
<i>Rick's been collecting
GoTron ferrets,</i>

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,700
<i>and now that he has all five,
we can combine them into --</i>

54
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:25,104
<i>Morty, for Christ's sake
spoilers.</i>

55
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,333
<i>Spoilers, Morty.</i>

56
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:27,597
<i>WE don't need
to sell this to anyone.</i>

57
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:29,174
<i>There's a giant
monster attacking.</i>

58
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,100
<i>In the Nibblenug system.</i>

59
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,103
<i>Since when does this house
care about alien lives.</i>

60
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,933
<i>We don't even watch
British television.</i>

61
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,696
<i>Told you. Let's just get
Gene from next door</i>

62
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,374
<i>and a homeless guy.
No. Hold on.</i>

63
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,770
<i>Fuck Gene.
Fuck the homeless.</i>

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,930
<i>Your kids and their grandpa
are asking you to do</i>

65
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,166
<i>an activity with them.</i>

66
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,770
<i>When did that stop being
a parent's wettest dream?</i>

67
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,700
<i>I guess around the time
our family created</i>

68
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,634
<i>a giant incest baby,
and the government</i>

69
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:49,927
<i>launched it into space.</i>

70
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,766
<i>Oh my God, we made a giant
incest baby.</i>

71
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,430
<i>Oh my God,
you might be a clone.</i>

72
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,367
<i>I exist because you guys
failed to abort me.</i>

73
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,430
<i>We get the family we get,
not the one we want.</i>

74
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:58,827
<i>And if you want to keep
the one you got,</i>

75
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:01,497
<i>get your asses into
some anime spacesuits.</i>

76
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,603
<i>-Fair enough.
-Okay.</i>

77
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:04,834
<i>Good work, Summer Camp.
Yeah.</i>

78
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,927
<i>I'm exci-toked
about this.</i>

79
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:08,766
<i>Sure you are -- now.</i>

80
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,500
<i>Morty:
Something new was forming,
and I was at the bottom of it.</i>

81
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,603
<i>Summer:
I let Morty have his voiceover.
It's really all he had left.</i>

82
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:15,974
<i>Okay, can you hear me
or not?</i>

83
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,600
<i>Do you mean can I, Summer,
hear you?</i>

84
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,474
<i>No. My voiceover
can hear your voiceover.</i>

85
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,670
<i>What's the difference?</i>

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,470
<i>One would be telepathy,
dumbass.</i>

87
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,930
<i>Now what?</i>

88
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,196
<i>Now, we --</i>

89
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,933
<i>All:
Go, Team GoTron!</i>

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,800
<i>Where are we zip-lining through
futuristic metallic tunnels to?</i>

91
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:37,934
<i>Each robot ferret is at a
different location on Earth.</i>

92
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:40,096
<i>You're going to the center
of a volcano.</i>

93
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,333
<i>Thank you?</i>

94
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,930
<i>Okay, well,
this isn't not fun.</i>

95
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:14,926
<i>Regroup on me.</i>

96
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,596
<i>I'll shoot a portal
to Nibblenug.</i>

97
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,174
<i>Did I just monorail
from my kitchen to Hawaii</i>

98
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
<i>just to regroup in outer space
above my kitchen?</i>

99
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:22,133
<i>Uh, Summer?
It's cool, Dad. Shut up.</i>

100
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:31,667
<i>Everybody,
attack one at a time!</i>

101
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,970
<i>Is that
the best way to --</i>

102
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,770
<i>Tee up something awesome?
Yes. Follow me.</i>

103
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,200
<i>Guys, we did our best,
but there's only one hope.</i>

104
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,673
<i>Activating link-dock.</i>

105
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,700
<i>Inter-Morphs -- rad-ified.
PostiTrinos -- maximized.</i>

106
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,597
<i>Holy shit, I-I can't believe
this is working.</i>

107
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:58,804
<i>Go, go, team!
It's GoTron time!</i>

108
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,833
<i>Oh, my God.
Hell yes!</i>

109
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:06,997
<i>This is amazing!</i>

110
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,603
<i>Okay, now we can
knock it around a little bit,</i>

111
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:09,774
<i>but trust me, we're still
building to something.</i>

112
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,130
<i>How do we --
Just hit buttons.</i>

113
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,326
<i>we're too big to fail.</i>

114
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,197
<i>I kicked him!
That was me, right?</i>

115
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,673
<i>Morty: Uppercut!</i>

116
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,770
<i>I can't believe I almost
went to the chiropractor!</i>

117
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,600
<i>I've been waiting
a long time for this.</i>

118
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:25,774
<i>Form Luminous Energy Sword!</i>

119
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,530
<i>That's your ass,
Mamma Jamma.</i>

120
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,097
<i>Morty: These were
the good times,</i>

121
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,133
<i>when we felt like
we could do anything.</i>

122
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:47,966
<i>But anything
is never quite everything.</i>

123
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,370
<i>And pretty soon...</i>

124
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,870
<i>That was nothing -- nothing
compared to what we can do.</i>

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,930
<i>There are infinite universes
where I still don't have
all five ferrets.</i>

126
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:56,696
<i>Th-th-those versions of me
would do anything</i>

127
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,304
<i>to complete
their collections.</i>

128
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:00,533
<i>Okay, but Rick, remember what
you told me to remind you?</i>

129
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:01,927
<i>Sometimes, enough is...</i>

130
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,696
<i>Sometimes,
enough is enough.</i>

131
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,104
<i>Morty, what are you doing?</i>

132
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:06,403
<i>He gets obsessed, Summer -</i>

133
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,603
<i>When are you going
to find your shame?</i>

134
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,074
<i>I have more.
Grandpa just gave</i>

135
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,930
<i>everybody the high point
of their lives,</i>

136
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,966
<i>and before he did,
every single one of you</i>

137
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,430
<i>was trying to talk him
out of it.</i>

138
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,927
<i>Wait. Yeah.
Wha-wha-what the fuck!</i>

139
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,596
<i>Now, he says we can go higher,
and big surprise,</i>

140
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:19,774
<i>it's time to
drag him down again.</i>

141
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,200
<i>Well, I vote --
No voting.</i>

142
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,673
<i>No debate.
It's not a democracy.</i>

143
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,530
<i>It's a Rickpublic.
You're in or you're out.</i>

144
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,497
<i>Obviously, I'm in.
I never said I wasn't in.</i>

145
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,503
<i>Me, neither.
Tell us what we're doing next.</i>

146
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,103
<i>Uh, I want to put together
a cookout.</i>

147
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,633
<i>That's it? I was honestly
prepared to blow someone.</i>

148
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,427
<i>-Jerry.
-I said "prepared"
and "someone."</i>

149
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:43,303
<i>Morty: Rick invited five
versions of our family</i>

150
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:45,933
<i>from different universes,
each with incomplete GoTrons.</i>

151
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:47,696
<i>I didn't have anyone
to talk to,</i>

152
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,774
<i>since the other four Mortys
had been to Boob World.</i>

153
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,200
<i>Did you walk
on the beach?</i>

154
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,433
<i>The beach that's all boobs?</i>

155
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:53,827
<i>No, the beach
that's all sand.</i>

156
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,367
<i>Yes, the boob one!</i>

157
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,830
<i>Rick was in the garage with the
heads of the five families.</i>

158
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,267
<i>Ugh, and Summer.</i>

159
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,500
<i>Summer:
In that first sit-down,</i>

160
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:01,703
<i>it was Big Fat Rick,</i>

161
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,504
<i>Ricardo Montaya,
Hot Head Rick --</i>

162
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:06,103
<i>he got that name because he was
prone to dramatic outbursts -</i>

163
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,573
<i>and Lil' Ricky Wrap-it-Up,</i>

164
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,100
<i>who was always great
at the end of a meeting.</i>

165
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:11,373
<i>At the head of it all,
me and Grandpa Rick.</i>

166
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,530
<i>Now, don't get
me wrong, C137,</i>

167
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,097
<i>we're happy
for your good fortune.</i>

168
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,833
<i>But we did not
travel to your universe</i>

169
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,497
<i>just to have it rubbed
in our faces.</i>

170
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,303
<i>Come on, Big Fat Rick,
you know your face</i>

171
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:21,633
<i>is too small
to rub anything on.</i>

172
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,927
<i>My face is the same size
as yours.</i>

173
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,996
<i>Wow. Huh. Hold on.</i>

174
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:27,273
<i>I'll be damned.</i>

175
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,100
<i>You're so fat
you're an optical illusion.</i>

176
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,473
<i>Summer, give 'em the pitch.</i>

177
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,830
<i>We're offering to help
each of your families</i>

178
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:34,327
<i>complete their
full GoTrons.</i>

179
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:35,997
<i>In exchange
for some concessions.</i>

180
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,433
<i>Ever since I was a little boy
in the slums,</i>

181
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,367
<i>I have dreamed of having
a complete GoTron.</i>

182
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,630
<i>But concessions?</i>

183
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,767
<i>I hope you mean
the kind from a counter.</i>

184
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,670
<i>I hope she means
ice cream!</i>

185
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,600
<i>We'd like you
to relocate your families</i>

186
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,134
<i>to this universe,
and let me make some</i>

187
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:50,626
<i>modifications
to the GoTrons --</i>

188
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,597
<i>in the interest of us
all working together.</i>

189
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:54,134
<i>Want to know
what I think?</i>

190
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,296
<i>Sure, Hothead Rick, just don't
unexpectedly fly off the handle.</i>

191
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:59,333
<i>I think you guys
got a lot of nerve
acting better than us!</i>

192
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,497
<i>This is the family that made
a giant incest baby!</i>

193
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,203
<i>Had the government
launch it into space!</i>

194
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,073
<i>It's still floatin' around
out there somewhere!</i>

195
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,830
<i>Are we ever gonna
live that down?</i>

196
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,997
<i>If I get a full GoTron,
it won't be by kissing your ass,</i>

197
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:12,103
<i>it'll be by taking
what's mine -- yours!</i>

198
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,933
<i>Hey! Gross!
No need.</i>

199
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,166
<i>And you were driving...
a ferret?</i>

200
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,600
<i>We all are, moron!
Give me key!</i>

201
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,730
<i>You'll regret this,
you level-headed fucks.</i>

202
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,933
<i>Obviously, we predicted
that might happen,</i>

203
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,866
<i>which is why we have
Yo-Yo Rick on standby.</i>

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,270
<i>Anybody got beef
with Yo-Yo?</i>

205
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:35,833
<i>Some people think he's lame,
but to me,</i>

206
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,767
<i>he's lame in a cool way
because he owns it.</i>

207
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,500
<i>Cool. That concludes business.
Lil' Ricky Wrap it Up?</i>

208
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,973
<i>Raise 'em up, boys!
Oh-pah!</i>

209
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,800
<i>Summer: And so, we helped
our people find their ferrets.</i>

210
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,334
<i>How they got them,
not our problem.</i>

211
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:49,697
<i>Then, we got down
to business.</i>

212
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:51,174
<i>Here's how it worked --</i>

213
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,130
<i>if a giant monster
attacked your planet,</i>

214
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,526
<i>we all got the alert.</i>

215
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,467
<i>Man:
♪ Hey, hey, mama mia's ♪</i>

216
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,800
<i>♪ Got a plate of spaghetti

<i>♪ A bit of pasta with some anime

221
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,096
<i>We formed
five GoTrons.</i>

222
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,603
<i>And those GoTrons
formed the GoGoTron.</i>

223
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:19,374
<i>All: Go, GoGoTron!</i>

224
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,600
<i>Man:
♪ Take it away, boys! ♪</i>

225
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:24,334
<i>Rick: I will never
get sick of this!</i>

226
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,367
<i>If you were a giant monster
at that time, in our universe,</i>

227
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,970
<i>you never had a chance.</i>

228
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,100
<i>Man: ♪ A bit of pasta

229
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:36,373

230
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,770
<i>Mine needs a weapon
like a Yo-Yo.</i>

231
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,970
<i>And a Yo-Yo on the chest.
Are you listening to me?</i>

232
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,770
<i>I-I need you to respect
this partnership.</i>

233
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,370
<i>I kept Rick removed
from the ugly stuff.</i>

234
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,770
<i>If you got in his way,
I got you out of the way.</i>

235
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,600
<i>And that made more room
to move up.</i>

236
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,374
<i>The head of my right arm.</i>

237
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,970
<i>Morty: Me? I ended up the left
foot of the left foot --</i>

238
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,530
<i>I guess because our robot
didn't have an asshole.</i>

239
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:57,927
<i>Summer:
Well, it had one.</i>

240
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:00,096
<i>Bitch! When are you gonna
stop breaking my balls?</i>

241
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,533
<i>You win, okay?</i>

242
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,197
<i>We're not competing, Morty.
And there's your answer.</i>

243
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,473
<i>I could move you up if I could
trust you to put family first.</i>

244
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
<i>H-how is that
putting family first?</i>

245
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,603
<i>Show me all the blueprints!
Show me all the blueprints!</i>

246
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,534
<i>I agree.
That's an issue.</i>

247
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,467
<i>Big Fat Rick, his flask stays
full or your locker gets empty.
Thanks.</i>

248
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,100
<i>I know it feels good
when he likes you,</i>

249
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,373
<i>but that doesn't mean
him liking you makes you good.</i>

250
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,430
<i>Solid babble, Morty -- like a
fortune cookie written by Borat.</i>

251
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,767
<i>Yeah, I'm not
as smart as you.</i>

252
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,100
<i>That's why I know
you know what I mean.</i>

253
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:25,933
<i>You mean, if I really
loved my family,</i>

254
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:28,196
<i>I'd give control of it back
to your jealous ass.</i>

255
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,803
<i>Green Ferret Four needs a wash,
and we're out of detergent.</i>

256
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,174
<i>I just bought a box.</i>

257
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,000
<i>And Grandpa snorted it because
you make him feel fenced in.</i>

258
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,733
<i>Rick: Sum-Sum?</i>

259
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,470
<i>Get two boxes.</i>

260
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:44,873
<i>one of the planets we saved,</i>

261
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,170
<i>and built a secret nightclub
on it,</i>

262
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,600
<i>a place no enemies
could find us --</i>

263
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,104
<i>unless you count
my brother.</i>

264
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,633
<i>Morty: I didn't even have
my own ferret anymore.</i>

265
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,027
<i>Summer made me
something called</i>

266
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,526
<i>an "associate
security chief" --</i>

267
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,767
<i>whatever the hell
that means.</i>

268
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,270
<i>Rick:
Look at this guy.</i>

269
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,600
<i>And look at this guy.
Look-look at this guy over here.</i>

270
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,500
<i>Oh, there she is!
My Baby Princess!</i>

271
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,603
<i>Get up here.
Stop the music.</i>

272
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:09,634
<i>This. Is. Our. Queef --
O-our Queen.</i>

273
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:12,097
<i>She saved my life.
She-she set me free.</i>

274
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:14,973
<i>We wouldn't have what we have
without this crazy bitch.</i>

275
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,630
<i>And she's got
a special announcement.</i>

276
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:18,497
<i>Summer, tell 'em wha-what
we talked about.</i>

277
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,703
<i>Now? I don't think --</i>

278
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,204
<i>Okay, I'll do it.
God damn.</i>

279
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,033
<i>Morty: The new job
did have some perks --</i>

280
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,426
<i>like, I got to be around
the night Summer realized</i>

281
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,927
<i>she was in
over her head.</i>

282
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:30,126
<i>Okay, I've got 90 extra ferrets,
which means I need 10 more,</i>

283
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:33,326
<i>and then four of you
get your own GoGoTron,</i>

284
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:35,597
<i>and 20%of you
get a GoTron,</i>

285
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:40,004
<i>'cause we're all gonna have
a fucking GoGoGoTron.</i>

286
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,433
<i>He's very excited.
Um...</i>

287
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,027
<i>Oh-pah!</i>

288
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
<i>I hate my family.</i>

289
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,033
<i>You should.</i>

290
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,326
<i>Get in.</i>

291
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,597
<i>How's it going with
your grandpa's compulsiveness?</i>

292
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,134
<i>Is your sister
still enabling it? Huh?</i>

293
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,866
<i>Who are you people?</i>

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,800
<i>Let's just say we're
the rightful owners
of these ferrets.</i>

295
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:02,204
<i>Then, why were they scattered,
and buried across the universe?</i>

296
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,203
<i>We mean in a more general,
cultural sense. Arrrgh!</i>

297
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,533
<i>What your Grandpa did
is called "appropriation."</i>

298
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,467
<i>Not cool!
Hunnnnngh!</i>

299
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
<i>Look, Morty,
we've been watching.</i>

300
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:12,674
<i>We know you're the one
that knows what's best.</i>

301
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,430
<i>Work with us
from the inside.</i>

302
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,127
<i>Help us take over
this operation.</i>

303
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,696
<i>We're literally designed for it.
Mm-hmmmmmm!</i>

304
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,004
<i>Nobody will know
it was you.</i>

305
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,603
<i>Then, you can get back
to what's important.</i>

306
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:24,034
<i>Are those Boob Bucks?</i>

307
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:28,466
<i>Legal tender at every kiosk
and ride! Huuunh!</i>

308
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,100
<i>I can't.</i>

309
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,373
<i>Summer's treating me like shit,
but she's still my sister.</i>

310
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,000
<i>That's really noble, Morty.</i>

311
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,003
<i>If you were in our family,
your loyalty would be rewarded.</i>

312
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,933
<i>But you're not in our family,
which means we can kill you.</i>

313
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,266
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

314
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,300
<i>Morty: And sure enough,
just when I stuck my neck out</i>

315
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:53,633
<i>for the family,
it got stomped on anyway.</i>

316
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,697
<i>-Dad!
-Mom! Dad!</i>

317
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,427
<i>Hothead Rick, baby!</i>

318
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,170
<i>I set myself
up for that!</i>

319
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,826
<i>-What the hell happened?!
-Hothead Rick.</i>

320
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,097
<i>How did he get
so close to us?</i>

321
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:11,603
<i>Morty was supposed
to be security!</i>

322
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:13,704
<i>-Morty?
-I-I-I stepped away, alright?</i>

323
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,004
<i>But-but not to
let that happen!</i>

324
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:16,973
<i>Morty, we're not
attractive strangers</i>

325
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,470
<i>next to you
on a flight to Paris,</i>

326
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,300
<i>traveling alone
to get over a breakup,</i>

327
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,873
<i>so this is no time
to be coy!</i>

328
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,300
<i>-Oh...pah.
-Lil' Ricky.</i>

329
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,803
<i>I'm all wrapped up,
Summer.</i>

330
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:28,874
<i>Guys, I know you don't trust me,
but what have we become?</i>

331
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,330
<i>Why are we
doing this anymore?</i>

332
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:32,027
<i>Because it's fun,
you little rat.</i>

333
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,696
<i>Now go home,
and play video games</i>

334
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,334
<i>while we clean up
these bodies,</i>

335
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:37,027
<i>or your mother and I will hire
people to break your knees!</i>

336
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,666
<i>This is $16,000
we got from the deep state</i>

337
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,200
<i>for stepping on
that trailer park.</i>

338
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,273
<i>That should be enough for school
lunch and home repairs.</i>

339
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,970
<i>Now, I gotta
turn my back on you.</i>

340
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,600
<i>No!</i>

341
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:48,934
<i>Summer:
With Morty out of the way,
things were looking up.</i>

342
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,866
<i>But looks
aren't everything.</i>

343
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,870
<i>Hi, Summer. Um, my cockpit's
not getting Wi-Fi.</i>

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,630
<i>Dad, you know that's not
what I do around here.</i>

345
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:59,697
<i>Oh, I'm not your Dad.
I'm a version of him.</i>

346
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,074
<i>This is my first day here,</i>

347
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,830
<i>and I-I'm not sure
what you do around here.</i>

348
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,997
<i>Then fuck off.
Oh, fuck you.</i>

349
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,133
<i>Excuse me?
I want your ID.</i>

350
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,870
<i>Mom. Are you Mom? Can you
control your rookie Jerrys.</i>

351
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,970
<i>Sweetie, we're all
a little overwhelmed -</i>

352
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,030
<i>Good point.
You're not a war-time Mom.</i>

353
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,696
<i>Why don't you find
your version of Dad,</i>

354
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:20,334
<i>and take a break,
take a holiday.</i>

355
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,267
<i>I don't have time to wait for
your confirmation,</i>

356
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,130
<i>so let's just say,
if you're here in 10 minutes,</i>

357
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:25,866
<i>I'll have you removed.</i>

358
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,800
<i>And then, the GoTrons
make the GoTrons,</i>

359
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,134
<i>make the GoTrons,
make the GoTrons.</i>

360
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:34,026
<i>Couple of snags, but I know
how to speed things up.</i>

361
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,196
<i>Remember when we talked about
how the best thing we could do</i>

362
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,533
<i>for the family is to recruit
outside the family?</i>

363
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:39,767
<i>Yes. Way ahead of you.</i>

364
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,300
<i>Summer, I want you
to meet Kendra.</i>

365
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:42,773
<i>She's from
a temp agency.</i>

366
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,770
<i>She's got an entire workforce
ready to go,</i>

367
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,630
<i>and all of them have previous
giant robot pilot experience.</i>

368
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,527
<i>So, we'll be ready to go
ahead of schedule.</i>

369
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,267
<i>Well, I don't know
about that but --</i>

370
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,430
<i>Well, Kendra knows. So...</i>

371
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,027
<i>So....</i>

372
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,703
<i>You here
to break my legs?</i>

373
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,834
<i>No. We're here to talk
shit about your sister,</i>

374
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,067
<i>because she just
fired us.</i>

375
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,830
<i>-You're kidding.
-Arrogant little bitch.</i>

376
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:07,797
<i>Should we clip her?
No. She's not worth doing time.</i>

377
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:10,504
<i>You wouldn't do time.
You brought her into the world.</i>

378
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:11,773
<i>So, I can
take her out.</i>

379
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,970
<i>You thought there was
an actual law?</i>

380
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,670
<i>It's a joke
mothers say.</i>

381
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
<i>What kind of fucked up world
have you been living in?</i>

382
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,504
<i>Uh, one where your mother
murdering you</i>

383
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,833
<i>isn't a
comedic premise?</i>

384
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,667
<i>Guys, there's a little
adjustment period,</i>

385
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,200
<i>but pretty soon, you're gonna
to return to normal,</i>

386
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,673
<i>and you're not going to
want to kill Summer.</i>

387
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,870
<i>You're not even gonna
be mad at her.</i>

388
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,430
<i>Nah, fuck her.
She's my enemy.</i>

389
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:29,597
<i>Should we kill ourselves, so we
can get to hell before her,</i>

390
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,104
<i>and hide near
the entrance?</i>

391
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,303
<i>I like that.</i>

392
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,433
<i>Rick fired me.</i>

393
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:38,526
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

394
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,697
<i>Are you okay, baby?
What happened to us?</i>

395
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,174
<i>We lost our minds.</i>

396
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,770
<i>I did it.
Morty was right.</i>

397
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,800
<i>I got addicted
to making Grandpa happy.</i>

398
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:47,104
<i>It's only because
your Grandpa</i>

399
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:48,703
<i>inflates the value
of his happiness.</i>

400
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,174
<i>That's a good point.
I mean, look at me.</i>

401
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,430
<i>I'm easy to make happy,
which is why</i>

402
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,027
<i>nobody gives a shit
if I am.</i>

403
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,766
<i>I appreciate it, but there's
something else too.</i>

404
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,170
<i>I've been really sensitive
about family lately</i>

405
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,670
<i>because of something
I've been keeping secret.</i>

406
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,930
<i>Okay. Who's on
the Supreme Court,</i>

407
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:04,326
<i>and what state
do we live in?</i>

408
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:05,727
<i>It's been years
since I've thought about this.</i>

409
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:07,327
<i>No, I'm not pregnant.</i>

410
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,927
<i>But as you guys recall, and as a
lot of people keep bringing up,</i>

411
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,966
<i>Morty and I did accidentally
create a giant incest baby,</i>

412
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,830
<i>which the government
did launch into space.</i>

413
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,967
<i>And I'm not sure
how to tell you this,</i>

414
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,600
<i>but it is still alive, and I
have been in contact with it.</i>

415
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:23,174
<i>There were soldiers waiting for
me outside school last month.</i>

416
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,270
<i>They took me to the Pentagon,
and briefed me.</i>

417
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,770
<i>And from there, I was shuttled
to a secret base on Mars.</i>

418
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,770
<i>They had captured him,
and wanted to see</i>

419
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,000
<i>if he'd respond to me,
instinctively, being his mother.</i>

420
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,433
<i>And he sure did.</i>

421
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,697
<i>But what they didn't expect
was that I'd respond to him.</i>

422
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,204
<i>I was supposed to help
discipline him,</i>

423
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,373
<i>so they could turn him into
the ultimate weapon.</i>

424
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,970
<i>Instead, I trained him to love,
to believe in himself,</i>

425
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
<i>and finally,
to escape.</i>

426
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,933
<i>The government doesn't want
anyone to know it happened,</i>

427
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:51,526
<i>but it's only a matter of time
before the story comes out.</i>

428
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:54,267
<i>And when it does, all we're
going to have is each other.</i>

429
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,270
<i>And you guys are a couple,
and Rick has Morty,</i>

430
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,770
<i>but I'm the odd one out</i>

431
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,500
<i>So, I wanted to make sure
we stuck together.</i>

432
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:04,833
<i>But instead, I drove us apart,
and Rick replaced me</i>

433
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:07,927
<i>with an anime girl,
so all I've got is myself</i>

434
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,766
<i>and my giant, tortured,
government-trained rogue</i>

435
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,470
<i>incest monster baby
out there in space somewhere.</i>

436
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,470
<i>Oh, baby.
What the fuck.</i>

437
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
<i>And then, you have to wonder,
what else are they doing
with our taxes?</i>

438
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,334
<i>Wait. Summer,
what did you just say?</i>

439
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:22,527
<i>Morty, a lot.</i>

440
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,967
<i>He replaced you with
an anime girl?</i>

441
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,700
<i>Big eyes?
Plus signs for teeth?</i>

442
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,774
<i>Ends sentences with weird sounds
that don't fit?</i>

443
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,430
<i>Yeah. That's going to be
his whole crew now.</i>

444
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:32,097
<i>And they're about to run their
first test on the GoGoGoTron.</i>

445
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,933
<i>Those people want
to steal the robots.</i>

446
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,926
<i>Th-they're gonna kill Rick.
He's all alone.</i>

447
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:37,426
<i>We-we-we've got
to go save him.</i>

448
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,127
<i>Right.
Or... you know, fuck him.</i>

449
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,996
<i>I'm good with that.
Yeah, fuck him.</i>

450
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:44,633
<i>Guys, a great leader once told
me you get the family you get.</i>

451
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,530
<i>Rick:
Alright. It works. Now, we just
got to find a giant monster.</i>

452
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,427
<i>My sensors have
picked one up, Rick.</i>

453
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:56,927
<i>Okay. Okay
Lock onto its location.</i>

454
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,126
<i>Yeah, got it.</i>

455
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,366
<i>Oh, it's you!</i>

456
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,700
<i>Huh?</i>

457
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,104
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

458
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,403
<i>Thanks for making
the biggest robot ever, Rick.</i>

459
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,473
<i>We'll take it from here.</i>

460
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,200
<i>You little assholes!</i>

461
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,833
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

462
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,727
<i>Lock a load, boys.</i>

463
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,100
<i>Say "hello"
to my little me.</i>

464
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,826
<i>Give up, old man.
The G3 is ours.</i>

465
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,997
<i>And last I checked,
your "family"</i>

466
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,873
<i>wasn't coming
to save you, hmm?</i>

467
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,630
<i>Giant Invest Baby:
Go go goo goo.</i>

468
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,427
<i>Holy mother of mercy!</i>

469
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,527
<i>My God.
It's beautiful.</i>

470
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:53,197
<i>Yeah! Family!</i>

471
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,103
<i>-Is that --
-It's exactly what
it looks like. Yes.</i>

472
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,103
<i>Congrats, man.
I see the resemblance.</i>

473
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:01,333
<i>Form the Energy Sword!
Activate the Goddamn sword!</i>

474
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:03,567
<i>Oh, man, the sword. Maybe we
didn't think this through.</i>

475
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,000
<i>They're not actually gonna
attack a space baby, are they?</i>

476
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,603
<i>I never thought I'd be
the one to say this,</i>

477
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,504
<i>but you need to watch
more anime, Mom.</i>

478
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:12,433
<i>Whoa, easy now,
Naruto.</i>

479
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:18,597
<i>Bahbah go bye-bye!</i>

480
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,126
<i>Kendra: What the hell
is wrong with you people?!</i>

481
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:27,626
<i>You just have
an incest space monster
in your back pocket, huh?</i>

482
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,097
<i>Welcome to
the Smith family.</i>

483
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,800
<i>Shit. Put that down, Naruto.
Your great-grandpa is in there.</i>

484
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:36,204
<i>What do you say?
One last zipline?</i>

485
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,873
<i>Incest space baby.
Nicely done.</i>

486
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,800
<i>Morty: After that, things pretty
much went back to normal --</i>

487
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:52,334
<i>some version of it, anyway.</i>

488
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,927
<i>Rick said GoTrons were lame
little kid bullshit,</i>

489
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:56,966
<i>and we never talked
about them again.</i>

490
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,370
<i>Summer:
Except all those gigantic space
bugs were still runnin' loose,</i>

491
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,000
<i>and there were no GoTrons left
to fight them.</i>

492
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,273
<i>Morty: Yeah, millions die
every day.</i>

493
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,470
<i>Summer: But you want to know
what they could never kill?</i>

494
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,670
<i>Family.</i>

495
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,200
<i>-Where's Jerry?
-Help!</i>

496
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,503
<i>Help! I'm still out here!</i>

497
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:14,673
<i>Morty: Yep, nothing's
more important than--</i>

498
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,470
<i>Hey! Hey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!</i>

499
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,830
<i>Ugh!</i>

500
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,597
<i>And just like that, I knew
our goose was as cooked as --</i>

00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:26,004

00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:58,767
<i>Won't happen again, sir!</i>

513
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,730
<i>Bugs,. Look to your left.
Now, look to your right.</i>

514
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:05,167
<i>None of you are coming back.
Not one.</i>

515
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,330
<i>In the entire history
of this program,</i>

516
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:08,697
<i>not a single bug
has returned.</i>

517
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,104
<i>Alright. Bring it in!</i>

518
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:12,003
<i>What are we?
-Normal-sized bugs!</i>

519
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,103
<i>-What do we do?
-Travel through
an interdimensional</i>

520
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,033
<i>gateway to a planet
with tiny people!</i>

521
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,796
<i>-Why do we do it?
-To spread the cure for AIDS!</i>

522
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:21,034
<i>Hey, Sarge, how do we know if
these little people</i>

523
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,126
<i>can understand us?</i>

524
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:24,026
<i>I mean, do these even
speak Buganese?</i>

525
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,166
<i>Funny, Palicki.
That's why we say it very loud.</i>

526
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,600
<i>Guys, you'll still be the same
civilized bug on their side.</i>

527
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:32,104
<i>It's not like
interdimensional travel</i>

528
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,873
<i>strips us of our clothes,
and makes us screaming monsters.</i>

529
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
<i>Or maybe it does.
It's impossible to know.</i>

530
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:38,573
<i>Now, get out of here!</i>

531
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,970
<i>My clothes --
where'd they go?</i>

532
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,030
<i>Man: Did you get any of that?</i>
